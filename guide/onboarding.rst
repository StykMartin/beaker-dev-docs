Onboarding new developers
=========================

For new developers who are getting started on Beaker, see 
:doc:`getting-started`.

This document is a brief checklist of actions for the existing team members to 
take when onboarding a new developer onto the team.

* Add the new team member to the developers@beaker-project.org mail alias
  (edit :file:`/etc/aliases` on the beaker-project.org host) so that they 
  receive notifications of new Gerrit patches.

* After the team member has created their Gerrit account, add them to the
  `Beaker Developers <https://gerrit.beaker-project.org/admin/groups/6,members>`_
  group in Gerrit so that they have Gerrit voting rights and their patches will 
  be granted Ready-for-Checks+1 score automatically.
